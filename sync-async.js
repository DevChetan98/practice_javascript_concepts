// Synchronous : Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instruction giving in the program.
// Each instruction waits for previous instruction to complete it's execution.

// Asynchronous : Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI. 
// Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instruction immediately and doesn't block the flow.
